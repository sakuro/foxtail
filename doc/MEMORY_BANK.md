# Foxtail Memory Bank

This document serves as a structured knowledge base for the Foxtail project, designed to be easily referenced by both human developers and AI assistants. It contains key information extracted from development guidelines and project documentation.

## Project Overview

- **Name**: Foxtail
- **Type**: Ruby library
- **Purpose**: Handling Fluent Translation List (FTL) files and providing multilingual translation capabilities
- **Target Ruby Version**: 3.4+

## Code Architecture

This section will be populated as the project architecture is designed.

## File Structure

```
lib/foxtail/                  # Main code
sig/                          # Type definitions (RBS)
spec/                         # Test code (RSpec)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fixtures/                 # Test data
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ support/                  # Test helpers
```

## Coding Conventions

### Language

- Ruby 3.4+
- Modern Ruby features: pattern matching, keyword arguments, etc.
- RBS type definitions in `sig/` directory

### Style

- Formatting: RuboCop
- Indentation: 2 spaces
- Line length: max 120 characters
- Naming:
  - Methods: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- Strings: Double quotes preferred, `%[...]` for complex escaping
- Hash syntax: `{ key: value }` (Ruby 2.0+)

## Design Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clearly defined responsibility
- **Dependency Injection**: External dependencies injected via constructor
- **Explicit Interfaces**: Public APIs clearly documented
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable objects when possible
- **Exception Handling**: Use appropriate granularity for exception classes

## Documentation

- Format: [YARD](https://yardoc.org/)
- Document:
  - Class purpose and responsibility
  - Method inputs, outputs, and side effects
  - Implementation intent for complex logic
- Style:
  - Use infinitive form for verbs
  - Empty line between text and tag block

Example:
```ruby
# Parse FTL content
#
# @param content [String] FTL file content
# @param locale [String] Locale identifier (e.g., "en-US")
# @param options [Hash] Additional parsing options
# @return [MessageStore] Parsed message store
# @raise [ParseError] If FTL content is invalid
def parse(content, locale, options = {})
  # Implementation...
end
```

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Individual classes and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions
- **Mocks/Stubs**: For external dependencies
- **Fixtures**: In `spec/fixtures/` directory
- **Coverage Goal**: 90%+

## Error Handling

- Use custom exception classes (not standard Ruby exceptions)
- Define all exceptions in `Foxtail::Errors` module
- Error messages should be clear and helpful
- Distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors

## Performance

- Efficiently handle large FTL files
- Minimize memory usage
- Report progress for long-running operations
- Consider buffering and async processing for I/O operations

## Versioning

- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- **Major**: Breaking changes
- **Minor**: Backward-compatible features
- **Patch**: Backward-compatible fixes

## Commit Messages and PR Descriptions

For detailed guidelines on commit message and PR description formatting, including examples of command line usage, refer to the [Commit Messages and PR Descriptions](DEVELOPMENT.md#commit-messages-and-pr-descriptions) section in DEVELOPMENT.md.

## RBS Type Definitions

- Use per-method `private` keyword instead of section-based approach
- Create directory structures mirroring implementation code
- Validate syntax with `rbs validate`
- Ensure consistency between YARD docs and type definitions
- Take special care with Data.define classes
- Consider external library type definitions when needed

## Development Workflow

- **Git Command Usage**:
  - Always use the `--no-pager` option when executing git commands that produce large outputs
  - This ensures consistent output handling, especially when commands are executed by AI assistants

- **Working Branch Creation**:
  - Always create a working branch before starting development of new features or bug fixes
  - Use descriptive branch names that reflect the feature or task (e.g., `add-ftl-parser`)
  - Create branches using the `git switch -c <branch-name>` command
  - For older Git versions, use `git checkout -b <branch-name>` as an alternative

- **Pre-commit Checks**:
  - Run RuboCop and RSpec tests before committing code changes
  - Use `bundle exec rubocop <changed-files>` to check code style
  - Use `bundle exec rspec <relevant-spec-files>` to run tests
  - Only commit changes after all checks have passed

- Follow the branch-based development model
- Create pull requests for code reviews

### Pull Request Management

AI assistants should use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR management:

1. **Creating PRs**
   - Use `gh pr create` to create pull requests
   - Include a descriptive title and body explaining the changes

2. **Pre-merge Checks**
   - Verify all CI checks have passed
   - Confirm required reviews are completed
   - Ensure there are no merge conflicts

3. **Merging PRs**
   - Use `gh pr merge` with standard merge (`--merge`) as the default approach
   - Use `:inbox_tray:` (üì•) emoji prefix for merge commits
   - Format merge commit messages as `:inbox_tray: Merge pull request #N: [PR title]`

4. **Post-merge Cleanup**
   - Delete the branch after merging (use `--delete-branch` flag with `gh pr merge`)
   - Switch back to the main branch if needed (`git checkout main`)

## Git Submodule Management

This project uses Git submodules for certain dependencies (e.g., `.rubocop` for RuboCop configuration).

### Initial Setup After Clone

After cloning the repository, submodules are not automatically populated. To initialize and update all submodules:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Alternatively, clone with submodules in one command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/sakuro/foxtail.git
```

### Updating Submodules

To update all submodules to their latest versions:

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

To update a specific submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --remote .rubocop
```

After updating submodules, you need to commit these changes to the main repository:

```bash
# First verify which submodules were updated
git status

# Add the updated submodule(s)
git add .rubocop

# Commit the submodule update
git commit -m ":arrow_up: Update .rubocop submodule"
```

This ensures that other developers pulling from the repository will get the same version of the submodule that you're now using.

### Important Warnings

‚ö†Ô∏è **NEVER directly edit files within submodules**. Submodules point to specific commits in their respective repositories, and direct edits will cause conflicts and versioning issues.

If changes to a submodule are needed:
1. Fork the submodule repository
2. Make changes in your fork
3. Submit a pull request to the original submodule repository
4. After changes are merged, update the submodule reference in this project

### Troubleshooting

- **Empty submodule directories**: Run `git submodule init` followed by `git submodule update`
- **Detached HEAD in submodule**: Normal state for submodules; only a concern if you need to make changes
- **Submodule changes not recognized**: Commit changes in the main repository that reference the new submodule commit

## AI Guidelines

### Code Generation and Modification

When generating or modifying code for this project:

- Match existing patterns and styles
- Include YARD documentation for new code
- Add explanatory comments for complex logic
- Design for testability
- Minimize dependencies
- Follow established error handling patterns
- Consider performance implications

### Command Line Operations with Multi-line Text

When executing commands that require multi-line text input (such as commit messages, PR descriptions, etc.):

- Avoid using double quotes for text containing shell-interpretable characters
  - Shell may interpret characters like `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, etc. within double quotes
  - This is especially problematic when including Markdown code blocks with backticks
- Prefer using one of these safer alternatives:
  - Single quotes (which prevent shell interpretation)
  - Heredocs (for complex multi-line content)
  - File input with `-F` option (creating a temporary file and passing it to the command)
- For git commit messages:
  - Use `-F-` option to read from standard input (recommended for AI assistants)
  - Example: `git commit -F- <<EOF ... EOF`
  - The hyphen after `-F` tells git to read from standard input instead of a file
- When working with GitHub CLI (`gh`):
  - Use the `--body-file -` option to read PR descriptions from standard input
  - Example: `gh pr create --title "Title" --body-file - <<EOF ... EOF`
  - The hyphen after `--body-file` tells gh to read from standard input instead of a file

See the [Commit Messages and PR Descriptions](DEVELOPMENT.md#commit-messages-and-pr-descriptions) section in DEVELOPMENT.md for detailed examples.

### Language Usage

- **Chat Interactions**: Use the user's native language regardless of the language used in the user's input
- **Code Comments**:
  - During planning phase: Use the user's native language
  - In actual code implementation/modification: Use English
- **Command Execution**:
  - Use English for all command line operations
  - This includes commit messages, PR descriptions, and other command outputs
  - Exception: When the command output is intended to be displayed to the user, use the user's native language
